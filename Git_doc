Blobs  ( Binay Large Object ) : Holds Files data but not file metadata
Trees : Tree is an object, which represents a directory. It holds blobs as well as other sub-directories.
Commits : Commit holds the current state of the repository. A commit is also named by SHA1 hash.
Branch : Branches are used to create another line of development. By default, Git has a master branch, which is same as trunk in Subversion. Usually, a branch is created to work on a new feature. Once the feature is completed, it is merged back with the master branch and we delete the branch. 
Tags : Tag assigns a meaningful name with a specific version in the repository.
Clone : Clone operation creates the instance of the repository. Clone operation not only checks out the working copy, but it also mirrors the complete repository.
Pull : Pull operation copies the changes from a remote repository instance to a local one. The pull operation is used for synchronization between two repository instances. This is same as the update operation in Subversion.
Push : Push operation copies changes from a local repository instance to a remote one. This is used to store the changes permanently into the Git repository.
HEAD : HEAD is a pointer, which always points to the latest commit in the branch. Whenever you make a commit, HEAD is updated with the latest commit.
Revision : Revision represents the version of the source code. Revisions in Git are represented by commits.
URL : URL represents the location of the Git repository. Git URL is stored in config file.
